It is strongly recommended that you use the included `vite-trpc-demo.code-workspace` file to open this project. This
will open the project as a VS Code [multi-root workspace](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/workspaces/workspaces#_multiroot-workspaces),
which enables per-package config files (e.g., `eslint.config.ts`, `prettier.config.js`) to take effect.
